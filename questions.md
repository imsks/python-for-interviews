2. [x] What are Python decorators? Write a custom decorator with arguments.
3. [x] What is the difference between is vs == in Python?
4. [x] Mutable vs Immutable types — how does it affect dictionary keys?
5. [x] Explain Python's memory management (reference counting, garbage collection).
6. [x] Difference between deep copy and shallow copy?
7. [x] Explain Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). How does it affect threading?
